[2024-11-23 13:36:21] Another.
[2024-11-23 13:36:21] Another.
[2024-11-23 13:37:18] On what to talk about.
[2024-11-23 13:37:28] And I thought I could talk about myself but that's going to be worrying for me and for you. I could talk about where I come from.
[2024-11-23 13:37:34] That was also going to be kind of boring to me, to be honest. So yeah, I didn't know what to talk about.
[2024-11-23 13:37:37] But then I had a brilliant idea.
[2024-11-23 13:37:52] I'm just going to talk about the things I love I'm going to have a lot of fun and you guys are going to be bored reward for helping you with the groceries today. I'm going to talk about the only trinity of my passions in life.
[2024-11-23 13:37:54] I love animation.
[2024-11-23 13:37:55] of anime.
[2024-11-23 13:37:58] And I love playing games.
[2024-11-23 13:38:01] So
[2024-11-23 13:38:03] What what do you mean about animation?
[2024-11-23 13:38:17] Do I practice animation? No, I don't. I never tried mating myself, but I love everything about it. I love the sound and I are trying to decide which movie to watch tonight, everything.
[2024-11-23 13:38:39] Well, our theater is currently showing and I am sure a lot of people will have some nostalgia with this, but I don't like funny movies. I prefer romance and action 15 years ago I was a kid and when I s, they're very boring. This is the coolest thing that I've ever seen.
[2024-11-23 13:38:50] What about an action, it has camera movement. It does amazing can you tell us more about it and fight choreography and from this moments that I love animation.
[2024-11-23 13:38:54] And this I can say that.
[2024-11-23 13:38:58] A lot of my life was shaped by
[2024-11-23 13:39:04] We aren't interested in movies all kinds of shows to watch something more mature.
[2024-11-23 13:39:05] Um
[2024-11-23 13:39:08] What about a horror movie? This is
[2024-11-23 13:39:16] Maybe animation is the horror movie that is no longer among us. He's called Monte. He showed us how we can
[2024-11-23 13:39:46] And do a beautiful animation with a lot of models, but just by creating parallel lines within the character you there is a little bit of romance it's very creative and beautiful. Really romance in a zombie movie. I can't talk about animation without talking about anime between one of my favorite animes of all time. It has sounds hilarious.
[2024-11-23 13:39:51] We'll take 2 tickets please and um special effects that.
[2024-11-23 13:40:11] I honestly haven't seen anything that matches something like this camera movement for me this is uh a piece of art, honestly, and about their daily routine forever. After the conversation, I will also ask about the next topic.
[2024-11-23 13:40:18] That to no surprise, my favorite is anime because that.
[2024-11-23 13:40:24] I can get from you because it's all animation obviously and
[2024-11-23 13:40:29] Um, I don't want to be on this too long, so I'm just going to talk about.
[2024-11-23 13:40:51] One anime that changed the way that I look at life and it's called My design is about enjoying doing the things that you like without worrying about what other people think. I will give you guys a quote from the ends have been full of making fun of things people clearly like.
[2024-11-23 13:41:00] If something that to you or something to you if someone likes it.
[2024-11-23 13:41:14] It's probably really important from them and it's also really important that you understand that someone likes my alarm goes off at 6 and I hit the snooze for at least an hour.
[2024-11-23 13:41:24] That you shouldn't agree to things you shouldn't feel forced to do things other people like why are you so tired in the morning.
[2024-11-23 13:41:29] This was just very brief on this topic. Are you enjoying the story?
[2024-11-23 13:41:59] Please give us a like. I just wanted to share those two quotes that changed the way that I look at life. Now, let's talk about go out with my friends for a drink at about 10 at night most of my life starting with midnight and I'm sure this is also going to bring some nostalgia video games or look at social media to play this game when I was around 4 years old. I was really, really small when I'm playing this game. I played it on the family computer.
[2024-11-23 13:42:05] My mom used to sit next to me watching me I think I'm addicted to my phone a long time.
[2024-11-23 13:42:10] And this is where I first got into this.
[2024-11-23 13:42:16] Another game that I want to mention that I played during most of my childhood.
[2024-11-23 13:42:24] Uh, was this one, I'm sure a lot of people know about the Ammar Games website with all the cool flash games.
[2024-11-23 13:42:25] From back in the day.

[2024-11-23 13:42:42] That sometimes I work there and I used to just play this game in the cash register while I was waiting for customers and
[2024-11-23 13:42:43] I had the time of my life.
[2024-11-23 13:42:45] Playing this
[2024-11-23 13:42:49] Uh, finally, I want to talk about a game that

[2024-11-23 13:43:13] I'm gonna break.
